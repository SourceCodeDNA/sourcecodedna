Source Code DNA
=============

Source Code DNA is a library of functions, classes, subroutines, etc., written in a handful of programming languages – PHP, JavaScript, Perl, C/C++/Objective-C. The code provided here was designed and developed as part of projects/products of various size and purpose; for applications, be they free or commercial. A good portion of it is also just the end product of research and development to test if some action can be performed, or how something works – in short the learning process. It has been made available here so Source Code DNA can serve as a repository for good reusable code.
